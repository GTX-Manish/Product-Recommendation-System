# Product Recommendation System using ALS
This project implements a product recommendation system leveraging the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm. The system is designed to provide personalized product recommendations to users based on their past interactions. To enhance the model and achieve better results, k-fold cross-validation is used, and the model's performance is evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric. The system utilizes Apache Spark for efficient data processing and handling.

## Features
1. Personalized Recommendations: Tailored product suggestions for users based on their preferences and behavior.  
2. Advanced Algorithm: Utilizes the ALS algorithm for efficient and scalable collaborative filtering.  
3. Enhanced Accuracy: Implements k-fold cross-validation to improve model performance.  
4. Performance Evaluation: Employs the RMSE metric to assess and optimize the model's accuracy.  
5. Scalable Solution: Designed to handle large datasets and provide real-time recommendations using Apache Spark.  

# Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Prepare your dataset and configure the system with Apache Spark. Dataset - https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets/amazon_v2/  
3. Train the ALS model using k-fold cross-validation and evaluate its performance using RMSE.  
4. Generate and display product recommendations.
